# Frequencies in a Limited Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  containing positive integers. The elements in the array arr[] range from  1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your have to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number **i**  (1-based indexing).

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5]
Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 0 times, 2 occurring 2 times, 3 occurring 2 times, 4 occurring 0 times, and 5 occurring 1 time.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 3]
Output: [0, 0, 4, 0]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 0 times, 2 occurring 0 times, 3 occurring 4 times, and 4 occurring 0 times.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 1 time, and there are no other numbers between 1 and the size of the array.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> frequencyCount(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length ; i++){
            map.put(arr[i], map.getOrDefault(arr[i] ,0) + 1);
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i <= arr.length; i++){
            if(!map.containsKey(i)){
                list.add(0);
            }else{
                list.add(map.get(i));
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
}

```
