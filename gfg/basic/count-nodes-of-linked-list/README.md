# Length of Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a singly linked list. Find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Output: 5
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 5, as there are 5 nodes present in it.

```

```
Input: head: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 7, as there are 7 nodes present in it.
```

```java
/* Structure of linked list Node
class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int a){
        data = a;
        next = null;
    }
}
*/
class Solution {
    public int getCount(Node head) {
        // code here
        Node temp = head;
        int count = 0;
        
        while(temp != null){
            count++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
